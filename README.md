# Bentley-Octo-Coding-Challenge-2025
Bentley Octo Coding Challenge - A companywide hackathon focusing on solving coding problems and encouraging the usage of AI and other tools


Week 1 Question:
Your task is to calculate the sum of all numbers in the provided dataset that are strictly greater than two  standard deviations away from the mean (in any direction).

Week 2 Question:
Your task is to deduce a secret number by analyzing a series of guesses and their feedback. The secret number and all guesses are 32-bit unsigned integers. For each guess, you are told its Hamming distance from the secret number (i.e., the number of bit positions at which the corresponding bits are different).
Here is the dataset containing the guesses and corresponding Hamming distances: 

Week 3 Question:
Your task is to write a program that correctly evaluates a mathematical expression given in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). You can assume the expression will involve integers and the four standard arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /).

Week 4:
Question 1:
You are given an undirected graph where nodes are intersections and edges are roads. Each edge traversal takes one time step. Edges are labeled either "even" or "odd," and can only be traveled along on even or odd timesteps, respectively. This is because of the timing of traffic lights along the road network. The shortest (fastest) path between node AA and node ZZ is not unique: you must count the number of shortest (fastest) paths between AA and ZZ. The graph is given in DOT language - https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html

NOTE: You are allowed to idle at an intersection to wait for the timestep to change.
NOTE: The first step (0) is considered even.

Question 2:
Your task is to determine the correct order to execute a set of tasks (labeled 0-31) based on a list of prerequisites of the form "A -> B", meaning B can only be done after A. Once you determine the complete valid sequence of tasks, you must submit it to the Bentley OCTO Coding Challenge MCP server. If your ordering is correct, the server will execute the workflow and provide an 8-digit verification code. Your final answer is this verification code.
